# Oracle Property Intelligence Platform Pipeline - Duval County, FL

## Context

The Oracle ingestion pipeline has been started, but the full dataset has not been completely uploaded, reconciled, or demonstrated. The infrastructure must be designed so Oracle does not carry ongoing infrastructure cost by default. For this candidate, they are acting as both the Oracle and the builder, so they are responsible for completing the pipeline and proving the infrastructure approach.

The pipeline must be **continuous and incremental** (ongoing ingestion of new and changed records over time) and must **publish eligible data artifacts to Elephant IPFS** (the Elephant protocol’s decentralized storage layer, following Lexicon / elephant-cli / Filebase+IPNS conventions used by the Elephant oracle skills).

## Description

Complete the Oracle pipeline by continuously and incrementally loading all available county property, permit, ownership, business, contractor, location, and public-source data for Duval County, Florida into an MCP-ready database. Use DuckDB for local/portable analytical querying and **publish the data (and query-table artifacts) to Elephant IPFS** so that Oracle does not carry ongoing infrastructure cost by default, while still enabling UI and agent access to answer property intelligence questions.

The pipeline must demonstrate that data is ingested on an **ongoing basis** (not a one-shot bulk load): support incremental / windowed refreshes, preserve run history with record deltas and timestamps, and re-publish updated artifacts to Elephant IPFS.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Confirm the pipeline covers Duval County, Florida.
- Design and implement the pipeline as **continuous / incremental**:
  - Support ongoing ingestion of new and changed records (scheduled or on-demand refreshes, change detection or bounded windows, idempotent steps).
  - Maintain a visible history of pipeline runs (timestamps, source list, record counts, deltas, any source limitations).
  - Demonstrate that data continues to be ingested and published over time (multiple runs or simulated ongoing updates).
- Load available property, permit, ownership, contractor, business, and location/coordinate records into the database (and keep them current via the continuous pipeline).
- Reconcile duplicate entities across all uploaded datasets.
- Preserve source provenance for all uploaded records.
- Optimize pipeline performance where feasible; identify and document slow source sites or constrained contractor data sources.
- Design the infrastructure so Oracle does not carry ongoing infrastructure cost by default.
- **Publish the data to Elephant IPFS**:
  - Use Elephant protocol conventions (Lexicon-aware artifacts where applicable, content-addressed CIDs, preferably stable IPNS pointers suitable for MCP consumption).
  - Publish eligible dataset artifacts (and query-table / open-data artifacts) via the Elephant IPFS path (Filebase or equivalent gateway used by the Elephant ecosystem, following patterns such as `county-open-data-publish`).
  - Make the published CIDs / IPNS references visible and usable by the UI, agent, and MCP layer.
- Use DuckDB for local or portable analytical querying.
- Structure the database to support MCP access.
- Enable agent access to query the database.
- Provide a UI for exploring the uploaded data.
- Support questions about properties with roofs older than 15 years.
- Support questions about properties with a view of water.
- Support questions about properties that have not exchanged ownership in more than 10 years.
- Support questions about properties with regional owners.
- Support questions about properties within walking distance of public transportation using property coordinates.
- Support questions about properties within walking distance of Starbucks using property coordinates.
- Return source-backed answers where source data is available.
- Demonstrate the continuous pipeline (run history + incremental updates) and the uploaded dataset through the UI.
- Demonstrate the continuous pipeline and the uploaded dataset through an agent query.
- Demonstrate that Oracle can operate without carrying the infrastructure cost (DuckDB + Elephant IPFS).
- Confirm the candidate fulfilled both Oracle and builder responsibilities for this milestone.
- Pass the demo using real uploaded county records and real Elephant IPFS publications.

## Demo Transcript

- Presenter: “I will demonstrate that the Oracle pipeline for Duval County, Florida is continuous and incremental, that data is ingested on an ongoing basis, that eligible artifacts are published to Elephant IPFS, that the data is queryable through DuckDB, and that both the UI and agent can answer property intelligence questions.”
- Presenter: “First, I am opening the pipeline run summary and history.”
  - Expected Result: The system displays multiple runs (or an ongoing history), source list, record counts, deltas between runs, timestamps, and any documented source limitations — showing continuous / incremental ingestion.
- Presenter: “Show the total uploaded records by source and the most recent incremental updates.”
  - Expected Result: The system shows property, permit, ownership, contractor, business, and coordinate records with collection timestamps, provenance, and evidence of ongoing ingestion.
- Presenter: “Now I am opening the DuckDB-backed query layer.”
  - Expected Result: The system confirms that the loaded data is available for structured querying without requiring Oracle-hosted database infrastructure.
- Presenter: “Show the Elephant IPFS artifacts (CIDs / IPNS) created for the uploaded datasets.”
  - Expected Result: The system displays Elephant IPFS content identifiers and/or stable IPNS pointers for the published artifacts, confirming they follow Elephant conventions and are usable by MCP.
- Presenter: “Now I am using the UI to search for properties with roofs older than 15 years.”
  - Expected Result: The UI returns matching properties, supporting permit or property evidence, and source provenance where available.
- Presenter: “Show properties with a view of water.”
  - Expected Result: The UI returns properties identified using available location, parcel, or geographic indicators and explains the source basis.
- Presenter: “Show properties that have not exchanged ownership in more than 10 years.”
  - Expected Result: The system returns properties with ownership history showing no recorded exchange within the last 10 years.
- Presenter: “Show properties with regional owners.”
  - Expected Result: The system returns properties where owner location or ownership metadata indicates a regional owner.
- Presenter: “Show properties within walking distance of public transportation.”
  - Expected Result: The system uses property coordinates to return properties near public transportation and shows the distance calculation basis.
- Presenter: “Show properties within walking distance of Starbucks.”
  - Expected Result: The system uses property coordinates and nearby place data to return properties near Starbucks locations and shows the distance calculation basis.
- Presenter: “Now I am asking the same type of questions through the agent.”
  - Agent Prompt: “Which properties have roofs older than 15 years and have not exchanged ownership in more than 10 years?”
    - Expected Result: The agent returns matching properties, explains the reasoning, and includes source-backed evidence.
  - Agent Prompt: “Which properties are near public transportation and also have regional owners?”
    - Expected Result: The agent returns matching properties with coordinate-based distance logic and ownership evidence.
  - Agent Prompt: “Which properties appear to be strong candidates for further review based on ownership age, roof age, and location signals?”
    - Expected Result: The agent returns a ranked or filtered list using available data and clearly identifies any assumptions or missing data.
- Presenter: “Finally, I will show that the system is MCP-ready and that the data is served from Elephant IPFS.”
  - Expected Result: The system demonstrates an MCP-ready interface (or documented MCP-compatible query structure) that can resolve the published Elephant IPFS / IPNS artifacts without requiring Oracle-hosted infrastructure.
